# Services Provided
User Authentication and Authorization: Securely manage user sessions and access control.
Profile Management: Allow users to create, update, and view profiles, including academic and personal information.

# How Services Support the UI and Application Functionality
The backend services provide RESTful APIs that the front end can consume. These APIs enable the front end to display information to the users, submit new data, and update existing data without handling complex business logic or direct database manipulation.
User data from the profile management services populate the profile pages on the UI.
Course data APIs allow the course pages to be dynamic, reflecting changes and enrollments.
Event APIs integrate with the calendar services to view university events and personal schedules.
